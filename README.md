## Setting up the database
To set up the database, open pgAdmin4 and create a new database called `a3-q1`. Then, open the SQL query tool and run the `a3q1.sql` script included to create the tables and insert the data.

## Running the program
To run the program, open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `a3q1.py` file. Then, run the following command:
```pip install psycopg2```
```python a3q1.py```

NOTE: you may need to modify the connection string in the `a3q1.py` file to match your database credentials and connection information.
